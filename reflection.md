- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance defineitly makes coding  quicker and more efficient. Having the Building class with its set attributes made creating the rest of the classes way easier.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
For my add and remove resident methods, it would throw a run time exception even though I had added the name of the person to the array list. I fixed this by printitng the array list to make sure that the name was actually in the list. The name was not in the list. Instead,"name" was in the list 6 times. I realised that my parameter for these functions was name as a string and not the variable "name". I changed it and everything in the house class started working smoothly.

After figuring ou the first class, the rest went smoothly. 

The last problem I had was with the restock part of the sellCoffee method. Initially I had used an if statement with multiple ors to restock each variable. This did not work as planned so I created multiple if statements.

Advice:
Printing things like lists or the varibales used in a function is a great tool when debugging.
